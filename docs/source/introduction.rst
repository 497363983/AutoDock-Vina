About AutoDock Vina
===================

**AutoDock Vina** (Vina) is one of the docking engines in the AutoDock Suite, together with AutoDock4 (AD4), AutoDockGPU, AutoDockFR, and AutoDock-CrankPep, and arguably among the **most widely used and successful docking engines**. The reasons for this success are mostly due to its **ease of use** and its **speed**, when compared to the other docking engines in the suite and elsewhere, as well as being **open source**. The source code is available at `https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina <https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina>`_.

Research groups around the world have modified and built upon the Vina source code, improving the search algorithm (**QuickVina2**), made the interface more user friendly and allow modification of scoring terms through the user interface (**Smina**), and improved the scoring function for carbohydrate docking (**Vina-Carb**),halogen bonds (**VinaXB**) and created an improved scoring function (**Vinardo**). Over the years many specialized docking methods were developed for AutoDock 4 but were never ported to AutoDock Vina. This happened because AutoDock 4 allows the user to modify a large number of docking parameters, providing direct access to some of the engine internals, with benefits in terms of flexibility and adaptability. Conversely, the Vina code is highly optimized and specialized, and one of its hallmarks is the very limited amount of user input necessary to perform a docking, making it harder to implement additional functionality, which requires changes to the source code. Examples of features that are available in AutoDock 4 but not in Vina are docking with macrocyclic flexibility, specialized metal coordination models, explicit waters hydrated, coarse grain models, and ligand irreversible binding adcovalent. The main disadvantange of AutoDock 4 is it's inefficiency. It can be 100x slower than AutoDock Vina. This severely limits the applicability of the specialized docking methods that were developed for AutoDock 4. The reason behind this large difference in performance is a much better search algorithm in Vina, especially due to the the BFGS local search bfgs, which uses the gradient of the scoring function to guide the ligand towards better poses, achieving good docking results in a reduced number of scoring function evaluations.
